# Implementation of PoP in PHP

PoP in PHP is an implementation of [PoP](https://github.com/leoloso/PoP), designed as a set of PHP packages distributed through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). 

The core packages are:

1. [Component Model](https://github.com/getpop/component-model): Implementation of the basic component model, dealing with component data (but no configuration)
2. [Engine](https://github.com/getpop/engine): Adds services over the component model
3. [Configuration Engine](https://github.com/getpop/configurationengine): It adds a configuration layer to the component model

We can extend the core to implement applications, such as the following ones:

1. [API](https://github.com/getpop/api): Implements an API for retrieving/posting data with the PoP component model
3. [Site Builder](https://github.com/getpop/site-builder): Build websites thorugh PoP
4. [Static Site Generator](https://github.com/getpop/static-site-generator): Export a static version of the website

## Install

Follow the instructions for the corresponding platform:

- [PoP API for WordPress](https://github.com/leoloso/pop-api-wp)
- PoP API for Laravel + WordPress (coming soon)
- PoP site for WordPress (coming soon)

## Codebase Migration

**Help needed!** üòù

PoP's codebase is currently being migrated to Composer packages. We are welcoming contributors to help with the migration, as to push forward the release date for PoP 1.0.

Currently, many PoP packages are split into 2:

1. The final package
2. A temporary, "migrate" package

The task is to migrate all code from the "migrate" to the final package, converting all code as required. The "migrate" package contains legacy PHP code written several years ago. The migration must introduce modern PHP techniques to the codebase, such as using Composer, dependency injection, autoloading and others. Once the code migration for each package is complete, the corresponding "migrate" package can be deleted.

Migrating the code involves the implementation of the following features:

- Adding package dependencies in `composer.json`
- Identification of services and making them available through [Symfony's DependencyInjection component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection.html)
- Adding namespaces for all PHP classes following the [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) convention, as to support [autoloading through Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading)
- Shortening of classnames (eg: from the current `PoP_Posts_Module_Processor_PostsDataloads` to `Dataloads`, after placing the class under namespace `PoP\Posts\ModuleProcessors`)
- Using `use` statements to import fully-qualified (namespace+classname) classes at the top of the PHP file, to make the code more legible (eg: instead of repeatedly executing `\PoP\ComponentModel\Engine_Vars::getVars()`, we can first import the class with `use PoP\ComponentModel\Engine_Vars;` and then execute `Engine_Vars::getVars()`)
